# Cool React Components

Hi, I'm Kotesei! 👋 I made this repo to put all the components I end up creating, either from inspiration or just stuff I end up using in my bigger projects.

## Roadmap

- Create at 10 smaller components
- Create 5 bigger components
- Figure out how to package everything up properly
- Be able to get components by simply doing npm install
- Create a site with documentation and how to use each component while also providing examples

| End Goal              | Progress | Last Component Created | List of Components                                       |
|-----------------------|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 10 Smaller Components | 2/10 ⏹  | QR Code Generator      | <li>Blog Card <li>QR Code Generator |
| 5 Bigger Components   | 1/5 🔁  |          Sidebar (In Progress)             | <li>Sidebar|


## FAQ

#### Can I use these components?

Yes feel free to! I'm putting them up here for anyone to use them.

#### How does the styling work?

I tried to give each item their own styling by using tailwind css but styling can be changed to whatever the user wants! I'll have to document where to define each class so it's easier to style.
